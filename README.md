recompose
=========

This repo is a clone of the abandoned [https://github.com/acdlite/recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) library so that we can maintain compatibility with newer versions of React. For full details and instructions on how to release new versions, please see [https://github.com/ThriveTRM/recompose-source](https://github.com/ThriveTRM/recompose-source).
